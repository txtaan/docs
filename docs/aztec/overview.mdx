The next version of our rollup, Aztec, is a privacy-preserving, programmable extension to Ethereum. It is a layer 2 ZK-rollup on Ethereum that empowers programmable privacy via composable smart contracts.

## Private Smart Contracts on Aztec

A smart contract on Aztec is a collection of functions, written as ZK-SNARK circuits. These circuits can have different modes of execution:

1. **Secret Functions** — Can read and write private states, read historic public states, consume or send messages to / from L1, and read Ethereum states. Moreover, they can call other secret functions in the same contract, or in other contracts. Finally they can call public functions.
2. **Public Functions** — Can read and write public states, write private states, consume or send messages to / from L1 and read Ethereum states. They can call other public functions on the same or other contracts.
3. **Portal Contracts** — These are contracts on L1 that can receive messages from L2, or send "allow" messages to be sent from L1 to L2 contracts.

Using these different modes of execution, developers can build applications with user privacy, data privacy and code privacy at their core.

**User privacy** — Transactions may not reveal information about the sender or the recipient.

**Data privacy** — Transactions may not reveal information about the payload of the transaction, e.g the asset or value being transacted.

**Code privacy** — Transactions may not reveal the program logic.


## How Aztec is being built

Aztec is being built and launched as a credibly neutral decentralized network. The protocol is being developed as open-source software by Aztec (the company) and its community. Together we are designing, building and auditing much of the software that runs by network stakeholders, such as infrastructure providers, in order to create Aztec.

Contributors to Aztec uphold many of the values of the Ethereum community -- building in public, a rigorous commitment to open source and a goal to build a permission-less, censorship resistance system.

## Noir

Noir is a domain-specific programming language for writing Zero-Knowledge circuits. On Aztec, a smart contract is a collection of circuits that developers write using Noir.

You can find more information and resources for learning about Noir on [this page](../noir).

## Cryptography

To support Aztec's rollup, our cryptography team is building [Honk](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg/tree/master/cpp/src/barretenberg/honk), a cutting-edge proving system that makes Aztec possible, all under the Apache 2.0 License.
